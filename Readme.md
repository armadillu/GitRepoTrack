#GitoRepoTrack

This is a simple Cocoa to app keep track of which of your git repos require commits. 

To use it, drop any folder that holds git repos onto the drop zone (bottom left) to set the path you want to scan. Then press "Scan!" to get a list of git repositories found under that directory. 

Repositories with uncommited changes will show a red status, and "clean" ones a green one. 

You can double-click any repo on the list to open a terminal window at that location.
