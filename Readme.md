#GitoRepoTrack

GitRepoTrack is a simple Cocoa app I decided to build for myself; to help me keep track of which my multiple git repos needs love. As you accumulate more and more repos, and work across different computers, it's hard to keep track of what is most updated.

To use it, drop any folder that holds your git repos into the drop zone (bottom left) to set the path you want to scan. Then press "Scan!" to get a list of git repositories found under that directory.

A quick glimpse at the status icon is enough to see local and remote state of the repository. You can also see how many local and remote files are changed / require merge.

You can double-click any repo on the list to open a terminal window at that location and see its status.
